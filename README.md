Artificial neural networoking:

>A simple neural network consists of an input layeer,'n' number of hidden layers based on the need and an output layer
>An Artificial neural networking(ANN) is a computional model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain
>It is used to design patterns and get the output

>>>I/P and O/P layera are connected to different layers through connecting channels.
>>>Each of the channels will have a value attached to it called as weight and each neuron in hidden layers is associated with a value called bias
>>>Bias is added to weights along with I/P and are applied to a function called as activation function
Activation function=x1w1+x2w2+x3w3+.......
>>>Activation function tells us if a neuron is activated or not
>>>The activated neuron contains information about I/P
>>>This process continues to happen until a neuron is activated to the O/P layer
>>>Weights are then adjusted and updated inorder to get a well trained network
